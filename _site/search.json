The central region of Singapore has the highest accessibility to junior colleges while the outermost western, eastern and southern regions remain relatively similar.

Hence, residents living in Punggol and Seng Kang have the shortest distance to access primary school education in Singapore. In contrast, the outermost western, eastern and southern regions of Singapore face less accessibility to primary schools as these are not residential areas.\nAfter the school closures and mergers in 2019, the overall accessibility to secondary schools remained the same with little to no difference in shading."

Similar to that of children aged 7-12, the distribution of students eligible for secondary schools (aged 13-17) have a similar distribution, with the population concentrated in the northern, northeastern and eastern regions of Singapore. Overall, there is an adequate number of secondary schools for subzones which are more densely populated with youths aged 13 to 17. There is at least one secondary school in the subzones with the population ranges of 4000 - 6030 and 2220 - 4000. However, the number of secondary schools can be increased in certain subzone areas, especially the northeastern region of Singapore. The subzones are Fernvale, Matilda and Anchorvale. Additionally, Yunnan is a subzone with no secondary schools despite being in the second most populated range of 2220 - 4000."

We used network accessibility analysis to evaluate the accessibility of schools at different educational levels (i.e. primary, secondary and junior colleges) using the QNEAT3 plugin and analytical hexagons. \nThrough creating multiple choropleth maps comparing the accessibility of schools before and after school closures and mergers, we will be able to visualise the accessibility to schools at different areas of Singapore, highlighting the areas which require better accessibility, as well as compare the changes in accessibility. \nWe decided to name our project ‘Vanishing Schools’ as our main focus of the project is the decline of schools across Singapore due to school closures and mergers. School closures and mergers have significantly impacted the lives of Singaporean students with one impact being the loss of fond memories of relationships formed with friends and teachers. Hence, we chose the word ‘vanishing’ as it best represents the nostalgic sentiments that come with school closures and mergers."
